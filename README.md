Azure API Management Trace Viewer
==================

Azure API Management has an awesome feature to view the request as it flows through the system. [Docs here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/api-management-howto-api-inspector/)

This is a quick little project to allow you to retreive and review the output of the traces from WPF or log to a file with the console app.
